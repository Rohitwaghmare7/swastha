# swastha

The project 'SWASTHA' was developed by me and my team members as a solution to one of the problem statements of 
Smart India Hackathon (SIH-2022). Our team had been selected for the finale of SIH - 2022 and we have created the
solution to the problem statement: " Develop Web Portal to detect the occupancy of beds in hospitals".
So, as a solution to this we have created a portal named "SWASTHA" for detecting the availability of beds in
hospitals. 
	This website was developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL. We developed a web portal
successfully for showing the occupancy of beds in hospitals. Also, we have added some additional features, such as:-
- A virtual chat-bot:
		This chat-bot works as a virtual nurse which gives us om-time solutions for various diseases and issues.
It specifies the cause of the disease, Medication to be provided and what precautions should be taken for fast recovery.
For e.g: if we ask about common cold then the chat bot will give us reply about what medication should be provided, 
what can be the cause of it and what precautions we have to take. 

- Hospital Bed Booking: 
		In our web portal, the user can not only check the availability of beds in a hospital but can also book
a bed in hospital from the comfort of their home. 

The basic aim of the portal is to detect the occupancy of beds in hospitals. The user can search by hospital name or
address and can get all the details regarding that hospital. The user can also contact directly to the hospital through
theÂ portal.
